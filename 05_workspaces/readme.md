# Workspaces

The sixth article of the "Practical Zephyr" series uses _West workspaces_  and thus moves beyond the freestanding applications of this repository. A dedicated [practical-zephyr-manifest-repository](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr-manifest-repository) is used for demonstrating _West workspaces_.
