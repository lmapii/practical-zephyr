# Example freestanding application

This is an empty [Zephyr freestanding application](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#zephyr-freestanding-app) used in the [first article](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/practical_zephyr_basics) of the "Practical Zephyr" series. It shows all files that are necessary to build an application. Browse the files and read the comments for more details - or even better, follow along the article series!

> **Note:** The [`tasks.py`](./tasks.py) script is used by the [GitHub action](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) for building this application using [invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/).
